im not gonna cap bro i cant be bothered 4 dis shit rn fuck this

I'm putting this here so if I ever decide to go back to it I won't completely forgot wtf I was tryna do here sorry if its rambling.

The motive is to have RNG that is fully controlled and consistent just from frame_timer, to avoid desyncs.
So the rand count and last caller thingy is all just to give the SAME RNG for every single call to rand(). 
If some return addr calls rand() multiple times it'll increment rand_count, re-scrambling the RNG
This gives us a new RNG value for any return addr that calls it multiple times

It seems to work for mobys/enemies syncing but particle effects are all fucked. 
I assume this is because some particle effects have several calls per frame. 
So although the address is technically different for each call, it's all within the same function. 
Meaning that everytime the address "changes" and it's actually in the same function, we just get the same RNG value sent back. 
Particle effects that exhibit this behaviour never get unique RNG values. 
Say it calls it three times within a function, with my current behaviour it'll give the same RNG value>therefore particle effects will be completely borked


Using __builtin_return_address(0) gets lr, which points to the instruction after the call.
If a function has multiple calls to rand(), each one gives a different lr, so the logic thinks it's a new caller every time â†’ rand_count gets reset repeatedly.
This causes all those calls to return the same scrambled value, breaking effects like particles
